# Please! We need to manage git ignore file so it will contain a minimal set of non-nonsense entries.
# Such minimal and precise exclusion list help reveal misbehaving / misconfigured tools
# and scripts, instead of blindly sweep problems under the rug.
#
# When adding entries here, please, do your best to briefly specify:
# * Which program generates or uses this kind of file
# * Why these files are kept out of the repo
# * Be precise about directories by placing leading / trailing slash where needed
#
# Quick reference on slashes:
# - Having a slash in front means that exclusion will only work on the top/root level
# of the repo. Otherwise we will ignore entries at arbitrary level of nesting.
# - Having a trailing slash means that exclusion will work only on directories.

# Executions of ad-hoc scripts and binaries allowed to create various temporary
# logs or stdout/stderr dumps in working directories
# We exclude them and ask to stick to this convention of using these filename extensions:
*.out
*.err
*.log

# Buck (or other tools) local config customizations
# Manually created to override main config, local and specific to a user
# Should be managed / backed up manually and outside ot the repo
*.local

# bun hole
/node_modules/

# Jetbrains Intellij IDEA project and module files,\.
# Can be present on different levels of nesting.
# Can be regenerated `node up --intellij` or recreated in Intellij
